Passionate Anything developer from the heart of Iran/Tehran, currently exploring the enchanting realms of **STEM** ðŸš€.

## ðŸ“š What I'm Into

Diving deep into the intricate world of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, I blend academic rigor with a thirst for cutting-edge innovations. My curiosity extends to the intersection of creativity and coding, where I bring digital art to life with animations and inventive solutions. âœ¨

**Currently, I'm crafting secure and efficient solutions at [Bepass Org](https://github.com/bepass-org), a GoLang project designed to bypass ISP Great Firewall (GFW).
